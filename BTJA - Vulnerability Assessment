# 🛡️ BTJA - Vulnerability Assessment

## 🔧 Tools Explored:
- **Nessus** – Hands-on scan performed on target machine
- **OpenVAS** – Covered theoretically
- **WPScan** – Analyzed a provided report

---

## 📚 Topics Covered:

### ✅ What is Vulnerability Assessment?
- A proactive approach to **identify and assess weaknesses** in systems, applications, or networks.
- Helps organizations **prioritize patching** and **reduce attack surface**.
- It is **not intrusive** – no exploitation is performed.

## ⚙️ Nessus (Hands-On Activity)

### 🖥️ Target:
- IP: **10.0.1.X** (Provided in lab environment)

### 🧪 What I Did:
- Launched a **Basic Network Scan** in Nessus
- Let it run and generate a full report
- Explored:
  - Open ports
  - Detected services and versions
  - Associated CVEs
  - Risk ratings (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

### 🧠 Key Learnings from Nessus:
- Understood the **Nessus interface**, how to launch scans, and read reports
- Learned how to interpret:
  - CVE IDs (e.g., CVE-2021-XXXXX)
  - CVSS scores (severity from 0–10)
  - Plugin info and recommended remediation
- Identified vulnerable services and outdated software on the target
- Saw how Nessus groups findings by **service** and **host**

## 📄 WPScan (Report-Based Analysis)

### 🧪 What I Did:
- Downloaded and reviewed a **pre-generated WPScan report**
- Did **not run WPScan manually**

### 📖 Report Covered:
- WordPress core version vulnerabilities
- Outdated themes/plugins
- Exposed usernames (via enumeration)
- Directory listing enabled
- Possible credential leaks

### 🧠 Key Learnings:
- Learned how to interpret a WPScan report
- Understood how WordPress security issues are tracked and scored
- Practiced identifying high-risk plugins/themes from a scan output
- Answered QnA based on scan findings (e.g., what's the highest CVSS vuln?)

---

## 📚 OpenVAS (Theory)
- Free and open-source vulnerability scanner
- Similar to Nessus in functionality
- Uses Greenbone Vulnerability Database (GVMD)
- Common in enterprise Linux environments

---

## 🔚 Summary
- Got hands-on with Nessus for scanning and reporting
- Learned vulnerability types, CVEs, CVSS scoring, and mitigation basics
- Analyzed WPScan output to strengthen report-reading and critical thinking
