# 🌐 BTJA - Network Analysis

## 🔧 Tools Used:
- **Wireshark** – Hands-on for all packet capture & analysis tasks
- **TCPDump** – Covered in theory (replaced with Wireshark)

## 📚 Topics Covered:

### 🧠 What is Network Analysis?
- Process of capturing, inspecting, and analyzing network traffic.
- Helps detect suspicious activity, troubleshoot issues, or understand communication flow.
- Essential skill for SOC analysts, blue teamers, and DFIR professionals.

## 🛰️ Wireshark (Hands-On)

### 🧪 What I Did:
- Captured live network packets
- Applied filters to inspect:
  - Specific protocols (`http`, `tcp.port == 80`)
  - Communication between IPs (`ip.addr == 192.168.X.X`)
- Followed full **TCP streams** to view complete conversations (e.g., login attempts, HTTP requests)
- Used **Endpoints tab** to:
  - Identify active IPv4/IPv6 addresses
  - Analyze communication flows
  - View packet/byte stats per endpoint
- Explored **Statistics > Protocol Hierarchy** and **IO Graphs** for traffic trends and breakdowns

## 📚 TCPDump (Theory)
- CLI-based packet capture tool
- Syntax learned (not used practically):
  ```bash
  sudo tcpdump -i eth0
  sudo tcpdump -nn -v port 80
