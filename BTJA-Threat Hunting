🧠 What is Threat Hunting?
Proactive approach to detecting advanced threats that bypass traditional security tools.

Focuses on uncovering IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) and TTPs (Tactics, Techniques & Procedures) used by attackers.

Combines threat intelligence + human analysis.

🔧 Tool: Redline
Developed by FireEye/Mandiant

Collects forensic data from a live endpoint:

Processes, loaded DLLs

Network connections

Scheduled tasks

Registry modifications

Memory strings, event logs

Can create a timeline of suspicious activity

Used heavily in incident response and APT investigations

🛠️ Use Case:

Detecting malware persistence

Analyzing artifacts left by attacks that AV might miss

🧪 File Hashing & Integrity Validation
Hashing = generating a unique fixed-length string (digest) from a file’s contents.

Algorithm	Bits	Purpose	Security
MD5	128	Legacy checksums, fast	Weak (collisions)
SHA-1	160	Deprecated due to collision flaws	Moderate
SHA-256	256	Modern standard in security tools	Strong

🧰 Tools to Generate Hashes:

Linux:
bash
```
md5sum file.zip
sha256sum file.exe
```
Windows:
bash
```
certutil -hashfile file.txt SHA256
```
Online: VirusTotal, online hash checkers

📌 Why Hashing?

Check if a file is tampered

Detect duplicates

Identify malware samples by comparing with threat intelligence feeds
