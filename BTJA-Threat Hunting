ðŸ““ Threat Hunting â€“ BTJA Notes
ðŸ”§ Tools & Techniques
Redline Tool

Used for endpoint investigation (collects volatile + non-volatile data)

Helps detect rootkits, malware artifacts, suspicious memory patterns

Generates timeline & indicators of compromise (IOCs)

ðŸ§ª File Hashing
Purpose: File integrity check, malware detection, verification

Common Hashing Algorithms:

MD5 â€“ 128-bit (fast but weak, collision-prone)

SHA-1 â€“ 160-bit (stronger than MD5 but now deprecated)

SHA-256 â€“ 256-bit (secure, widely used)

Tools: sha256sum, md5sum, certutil, online tools

ðŸŽ“ Certification Awareness
Learned about eLearnSecurity certs (like eCTHP, eCIR)

Practical-oriented blue team certs

Valued in SOC/DFIR roles
